Spring Data JPA provides repository support for the Java Persistence API (JPA).
It is library/framework that adds an extra layer of abstraction on the top of our JPA provider.
It simply “hides” the Java Persistence API and the JPA provider behind its repository abstraction.

DB used in this project is apache derby which is an embedded one in this case and resides in JVM.
